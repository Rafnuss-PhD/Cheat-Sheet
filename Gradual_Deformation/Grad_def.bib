abstract = {This paper describes a newmethod for gradually deforming realizations of Gaussian-related stochastic models while preserving their spatial variability. This method consists in building a stochastic process whose state space is the ensemble of the realizations of a spatial stochastic model. In particular, a stochastic process, built by combining independent Gaussian random functions, is proposed to perform the gradual deformation of realizations. Then, the gradual deformation algorithm is coupled with an optimization algorithm to calibrate realizations of stochastic models to nonlinear data. The method is applied to calibrate a continuous and a discrete synthetic permeability fields to well-test pressure data. The examples illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Furthermore, we present some extensions of this method (multidimensional gradual deformation, gradual deformation with respect to structural parameters, and local gradual deformation) that are useful in practice. Although the method described in this paper is operational only in the Gaussian framework (e.g., lognormal model, truncated Gaussian model, etc.), the idea of gradually deforming realizations through a stochastic process remains general and therefore promising even for calibrating non-Gaussian models},

abstract = {Constraining stochastic models of reservoir properties such as porosity and permeability can be formulated as an optimization problem. While an optimization based on random search methods preserves the spatial variability of the stochastic model, it is prohibitively computer intensive. In contrast, gradient search methods may be very efficient but it does not preserve the spatial variability of the stochastic model. The gradual deformation method allows for modifying a reservoir model (i.e., realization of the stochastic model) from a small number of parameters while preserving its spatial variability. It can be considered as a first step towards the merger of random and gradient search methods. The gradual deformation method yields chains of reservoir models that can be investigated successively to identify an optimal reservoir model. The investigation of each chain is based on gradient computations, but the building of chains of reservoir models is random. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that further improves the efficiency of the gradual deformation method. Contrary to the previous gradual deformation method, we also use gradient information to build chains of reservoir models. The idea is to combine the initial reservoir model or the previously optimized reservoir model with a compound reservoir model. This compound model is a linear combination of a set of independent reservoir models. The combination coefficients are calculated so that the search direction from the initial model is as close as possible to the gradient search direction. This new gradual deformation scheme allows us for reducing the number of optimization parameters while selecting an optimal search direction. The numerical example compares the performance of the new gradual deformation scheme with that of the traditional one.},
